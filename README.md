# flexiHour

A customizable web-based clock where you can define the length of an hour in minutes.

Features

    Custom Time System: Redefine how long an "hour" is by setting a custom duration in standard minutes.

    Dual Display: Features both a responsive analog clock and a large digital display.

    Dynamic Face: The analog clock face dynamically adjusts its hour markers based on your custom time system.

    Real-Time Updates: All changes are applied instantly without needing to refresh the page.

    Sleek Interface: A modern, dark-themed UI built with Tailwind CSS.

    No Dependencies: Runs entirely in the browser from a single, self-contained HTML file.

How to Use

    Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

    In the "Define Your Hour" section, enter the number of minutes you want to constitute a single custom hour.

    Click the "Apply" button.
